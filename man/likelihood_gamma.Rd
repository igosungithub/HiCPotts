\title{Likelihood Function for the Interaction Parameter in a Potts Model}
\usage{
likelihood_gamma(x, pair_neighbours_DA_x1, N)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector representing the interaction parameter(s) for the Potts model. 
This could be a single parameter repeated for each pair of neighbors.}

\item{pair_neighbours_DA_x1}{A numeric vector of the same length as \code{x}, representing the pairwise interaction 
structure between neighbors in the Potts model. Each element indicates whether a pair of sites is assigned 
as neighbors.}

\item{N}{An integer specifying the dimension of the Potts lattice. The returned matrix will be \code{N} by \code{N}, 
representing the spatial layout of the Potts model.}
}
\value{
A numeric \code{N x N} matrix of normalized probabilities corresponding to the Potts model likelihood 
for the given interaction parameter. Each element of the matrix represents the likelihood contribution of 
that site/pair under the model parameterized by \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function computes the matrix of probabilities (or likelihood values) associated with the interaction parameter 
in the Potts model. The Potts model is a generalization of the Ising model and is commonly used in spatial statistics, 
image analysis, and other fields where data can be represented on a lattice. The interaction parameter controls 
how neighboring sites on the lattice influence each other.
}
\details{
The Potts model describes configurations of states on a lattice, where the interaction parameter \code{x} 
influences how often neighboring sites are in the same state. The likelihood or probability of a 
configuration is determined by exponentials of the interaction terms between neighboring sites.

This function:
\enumerate{
  \item Multiplies the interaction parameter vector \code{x} by the vector \code{pair_neighbours_DA_x1}, which encodes 
        neighbor relationships or their contributions.
  \item Applies a stability adjustment by subtracting the maximum value (\code{max_val}) from each term 
        \eqn{x * pair\_neighbours\_DA\_x1} to avoid numerical overflow.
  \item Exponentiates these adjusted values and normalizes them to obtain a set of values that sum to 1, 
        interpreting them as probabilities or likelihood contributions.
  \item Reshapes these normalized values into an \code{N x N} matrix, \code{potts_DA}, which represents 
        the spatial layout of likelihoods (or probabilities) under the Potts model.
}

\examples{
# Suppose we have an N=4 lattice and a vector x and pair_neighbours_DA_x1 of length 16
N <- 4
x <- rep(0.5, N*N)  # interaction parameter repeated for each pair
pair_neighbours_DA_x1 <- rnorm(N*N)  # random neighbor influences

# Compute the Potts DA matrix
potts_matrix <- likelihood_gamma(x, pair_neighbours_DA_x1, N)
