\usage{
process_data(data, N, scale_max = 500, standardization_y = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.frame} containing the following required columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{start}: Numeric start coordinates for locus i.
  \item \code{end}: Numeric end coordinates for locus j.
  \item \code{interactions}: Numeric vector of observed interaction counts between loci i and j.
  \item \code{GC}: GC content measure for the given loci.
  \item \code{ACC}: Accessibility score for the given loci.
  \item \code{TES}: A measure related to transposable elements for the given loci.
}}

\item{N}{An integer specifying the dimension of the resulting \eqn{N \times N} matrices. The data 
provided should correspond to \eqn{N^2} interactions or multiples thereof, as it will be reshaped 
into one or more \eqn{N \times N} matrices.}

\item{scale_max}{A numeric value indicating the maximum scaling factor for interaction counts 
when \code{standardization_y = TRUE}. Defaults to 500. After scaling, interaction counts 
range between [1, \code{scale_max}].}

\item{standardization_y}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, interaction counts are scaled to the 
range [1, \code{scale_max}] by applying a min-max normalization and rounding. If \code{FALSE}, 
the raw interaction counts are used as provided.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{\code{x_vars}}{A named list containing lists of \eqn{N \times N} matrices for each covariate: 
  \code{distance}, \code{GC}, \code{TES}, \code{ACC}.}

  \item{\code{y}}{A list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices representing the (scaled) interaction counts 
  corresponding to the covariates in \code{x_vars}.}
}
}
\description{
The \code{process_data} function takes a data frame with interaction information and associated covariates 
(genomic bins, GC content, transposable elements(TES), and accessibility) and converts it into 
a structured list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices suitable for modeling. It also provides options for scaling interaction counts and checking for 
required columns and missing values.
}
\details{
This function processes a long-format data frame where each row represents an interaction between 
two loci (denoted by \code{start} and \code{end}) and associated covariate values. 
Key steps include:
\enumerate{
  \item Validating that required columns are present and checking for missing values.
  \item Optionally scaling the interaction counts to a fixed range to reduce skew or prepare data 
        for models sensitive to the magnitude of counts.
  \item Computing genomic distances as \eqn{|end - start|}.
  \item Reshaping the vectorized interaction and covariate data into \eqn{N \times N} matrices. 
        If the number of rows in \code{data} is greater than \eqn{N^2}, it splits them into multiple 
        \eqn{N \times N} matrices (one for each segment of length \eqn{N^2}).
  \item Storing the resulting data in a list structure suitable for downstream analyses.
}

The returned \code{x_vars} list contains multiple \eqn{N \times N} matrices for each covariate:
\itemize{
  \item \code{x_vars$distance}: A list of one or more \eqn{N \times N} matrices containing genomic distances.
  \item \code{x_vars$GC}: A list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices for GC content.
  \item \code{x_vars$TES}: A list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices for TES values.
  \item \code{x_vars$ACC}: A list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices for accessibility scores.
}

The \code{y} element in the returned list contains the scaled (or raw) interaction counts structured 
as a list of \eqn{N \times N} matrices.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose we have a data frame 'df' with columns: start, end, interactions, GC, ACC, TES
# and we know that df corresponds to a 10x10 interaction matrix (N=10).

# Process the data, scaling interaction counts to [1, 500]
processed <- process_data(df, N=10, scale_max=500, standardization_y=TRUE)

# Extract covariates and interaction matrices
x_vars <- processed$x_vars
y_matrices <- processed$y

# Each element in x_vars and y_matrices is now a list of one or more 10x10 matrices.
